# Ethereum Block Explorer

This repository holds a simple Ethereum blockchain explorer. The dashboard displays the 10 latest blocks, and users can inspect the details of an individual block, as well as the details of an Ethereum address.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Create an environment file `.env.local` and populate it with the link to an Ethereum node endpoint in the format `NEXT_PUBLIC_NODE_URL={YOUR_URL}`.

Then, install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
